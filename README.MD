## Introduction

Welcome to the Employee Management System repository! This project is designed to simplify and streamline human resources processes within an organization. It includes features for managing employee and department data and handles employee assignments and promotions.

While we couldn't provide a fully functional working model due to some unresolved bugs and time constraints, we've developed the entire backend of the application, which can serve as a solid foundation for further development.

## Features

### 1. Employee Details

The Employee Management System allows you to store and manage employee information, including:

- Employee ID
- Name
- Email
- Contact number
- Date of joining
- Years of experience

### 2. Department Details

Manage department information efficiently with attributes like:

- Department ID
- Department name
- Location
- Manager ID

### 3. Employee-Department Assignment

Easily assign employees to departments. Note that each employee can be assigned to only one department at a time.

### 4. Employee Promotion

Identify eligible employees for promotion to manager positions based on their years of experience. To be considered for a manager role, an employee must have a minimum of 5 years of experience, validated using the date of joining.

## Repository Content

- The core of our work is in the **backend section** of the code. We have implemented the data models, APIs, and business logic that drive the Employee Management System.

- While we couldn't provide a working model, we encourage contributors to build upon our existing work, address bugs, and add additional features.
